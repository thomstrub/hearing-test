# Hearing Test

[Hearing Test on GitHub Pages][1]

This <strong> Hearing Test </strong> is my attempt to copy a program on a computer I had when I was a kid -[Similar to this test](https://archive.org/details/msdos_festival_HEARING). I don't think it tells you if you've had any hearing damage, but it's still fun. To begin the test, press start. Press stop when you can no longer hear the tone and record your score.
